                    As one of the most revolutionary emerging technologies in recent years, Blockchain has made a big impact on our world.  By building trust in a decentralized way, it arouses public attention of many industries, including governments, financial institutions, enterprises, news medias and so on. However, Blockchain is not a panacea! There are still a few problems related
                    to Blockchain to be solved, such as transaction efficiency and privacy protection. The goal of the 2017 Blockchain Technology and Systems workshop is to bring together internationally leading academic and industrial researchers in an effort to identify and discuss the major technical challenges and recent results aimed at addressing the problems concerned to Blockchain.
